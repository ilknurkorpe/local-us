## Project setup

```
Vue projects run on Node.js and use npm or Yarn as package manager.

You can type node -v and npm -v (or yarn -v) in the terminal to check if they are installed.

If they are not installed, you can download them from the Node.js official website (https://nodejs.org/). npm is bundled with Node.js. If you want to use yarn, you can install it with npm using the command npm install -g yarn.
```

```
You will need Git to clone the repo from GitHub.

You can type git --version in the terminal to check if it is installed.

If it is not installed, you can download it from the Git official website (https://git-scm.com/).
